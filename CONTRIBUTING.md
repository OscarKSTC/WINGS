## Development Process

Our workflow:

## Setting up your development environment

Follow the instructions in our [README](README.md#development-process) to install prerequisites and run the project locally.

## Issues & Pull Requests

When creating a new issue, use one of the available templates (Bug report, Feature request, etc.) where applicable. Make use of relevant [labels](https://github.com/UMN-Rocket-Team/WINGS/labels) in your issue and PR. 

## Commit Guidelines
- Commit frequently, they're easier to digest when you don't commit all of your changes for a new feature at the same time.
- Keep commit messages brief, yet descriptive
- Use present tense in commit messages:
    - Good example: `Add telemetry packet parser`
    - Bad example: `Added telemetry packet parser`
